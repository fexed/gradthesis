abstract = {Affect recognition aims to detect a person's affective state based on observables,
with the goal to e.g. improve human-computer interaction. Long-term stress is known
to have severe implications on wellbeing, which call for continuous and automated
stress monitoring systems. However, the affective computing community lacks commonly
used standard datasets for wearable stress detection which a) provide multimodal high-quality
data, and b) include multiple affective states. Therefore, we introduce WESAD, a new
publicly available dataset for wearable stress and affect detection. This multimodal
dataset features physiological and motion data, recorded from both a wrist- and a
chest-worn device, of 15 subjects during a lab study. The following sensor modalities
are included: blood volume pulse, electrocardiogram, electrodermal activity, electromyogram,
respiration, body temperature, and three-axis acceleration. Moreover, the dataset
bridges the gap between previous lab studies on stress and emotions, by containing
three different affective states (neutral, stress, amusement). In addition, self-reports
of the subjects, which were obtained using several established questionnaires, are
contained in the dataset. Furthermore, a benchmark is created on the dataset, using
well-known features and standard machine learning methods. Considering the three-class
classification problem ( baseline vs. stress vs. amusement ), we achieved classification
accuracies of up to 80%,. In the binary case ( stress vs. non-stress ), accuracies
of up to 93%, were reached. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis and comparison
of the two device locations ( chest vs. wrist ) as well as the different sensor modalities.},

abstract = {The widespread presence of motion sensors on users' personal mobile devices has spawned
a growing research interest in human activity recognition (HAR). However, when deployed
at a large-scale, e.g., on multiple devices, the performance of a HAR system is often
significantly lower than in reported research results. This is due to variations in
training and test device hardware and their operating system characteristics among
others. In this paper, we systematically investigate sensor-, device- and workload-specific
heterogeneities using 36 smartphones and smartwatches, consisting of 13 different
device models from four manufacturers. Furthermore, we conduct experiments with nine
users and investigate popular feature representation and classification techniques
in HAR research. Our results indicate that on-device sensor and sensor handling heterogeneities
impair HAR performances significantly. Moreover, the impairments vary significantly
across devices and depends on the type of recognition technique used. We systematically
evaluate the effect of mobile sensing heterogeneities on HAR and propose a novel clustering-based
mitigation technique suitable for large-scale deployment of HAR, where heterogeneity
of devices and their usage scenarios are intrinsic.},

  abstract = 	 {While logistic sigmoid neurons are more biologically plausible than hyperbolic tangent neurons, the latter work better for training multi-layer neural networks. This paper shows that rectifying neurons are an even better model of biological neurons and yield equal or better performance than hyperbolic tangent networks in spite of the hard non-linearity and non-differentiability at zero, creating sparse representations with true zeros which seem remarkably suitable for naturally sparse data. Even though they can take advantage of semi-supervised setups with extra-unlabeled data, deep rectifier networks can reach their best performance without requiring any unsupervised pre-training on purely supervised tasks with large labeled datasets. Hence, these results can be seen as a new milestone in the attempts at understanding the difficulty in training deep but purely supervised neural networks, and closing the performance gap between neural networks learnt with and without unsupervised pre-training.

abstract = {Publisher Summary
Connectionist networks in which information is stored in weights on connections among simple processing units have attracted considerable interest in cognitive science. Much of the interest centers around two characteristics of these networks. First, the weights on connections between units need not be prewired by the model builder but rather may be established through training in which items to be learned are presented repeatedly to the network and the connection weights are adjusted in small increments according to a learning algorithm. Second, the networks may represent information in a distributed fashion. This chapter discusses the catastrophic interference in connectionist networks. Distributed representations established through the application of learning algorithms have several properties that are claimed to be desirable from the standpoint of modeling human cognition. These properties include content-addressable memory and so-called automatic generalization in which a network trained on a set of items responds correctly to other untrained items within the same domain. New learning may interfere catastrophically with old learning when networks are trained sequentially. The analysis of the causes of interference implies that at least some interference will occur whenever new learning may alter weights involved in representing old learning, and the simulation results demonstrate only that interference is catastrophic in some specific networks.}

recognition of the big-five traits from Electrocardiogram (ECG), Galvanic Skin Response

scales and (explicit) affective user ratings acquired in the context of prior observations.
Secondly, we isolate physiological correlates of personality traits. Finally, unimodal
and multimodal personality recognition results are presented. Personality differences
are better revealed while analyzing responses to emotionally homogeneous (e.g., high
valence, high arousal) clips, and significantly above-chance recognition is achieved
for all five traits.},
